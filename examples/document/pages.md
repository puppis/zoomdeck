::: slide {#first width=20}
# A deck of plain slides

This file lists slides and includes none of them, so every slide is a root of the deck's forest. The roots are visited first to last, and the player cuts from each to the next without a camera move.

Press the right arrow. {color=GRAY}

::: slide {#second width=20}
## The second page

[Pages can still have steps]{#a step=1}

[And reveal them one at a time]{#b below:#a left-aligned:#a step=2}

A page may also include children of its own, as the next one does: inside a page the deck zooms as usual. {y=-3 font_size=20 color=GRAY}
:::

::: slide {#third width=20}
## The third page has a child

[[include: #detail x=5 y=-1.2 width=8]]

The camera zooms into the child and, since it is the last one, back out to this root; then the deck ends here. {x=-9.3 y=-3.6 width=10 font_size=20 color=GRAY}

::: slide {#detail}
### A detail

Children of a page keep their zooms; only the pages themselves cut. {font_size=22}
